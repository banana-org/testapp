This basic GameBanana App has 2 features:

- A Navigator Tab
- A Profile Module

When you install this app (http://gamebanana.com/apps/2), it will appear in your profile and in your navigator.

# The Navigator Tab

When you roll over this App's Navigator Tab, a request will be made to the
Navigator Tab URL specified in Test App's edit form (which is: http://banana.org/testapp.php?nav).
The response is then printed in the Navigator Tab.

# The Profile Module

In your profile, you should see a module called "Test Module". The contents of this module is
generated from the request made to the Profile Module URL specified in Test App's edit form (which is: http://banana.org/testapp.php).
The response is then printed in the Profile Module.
